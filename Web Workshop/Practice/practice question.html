        The best ways to start your HTML journey is by creating a personal portfolio page. 
        This project allows you to introduce yourself to the world of web development while learning the basics of HTML.
        It’s not just about coding; it’s about telling your story through the web.</pre><br>
        
    
            <pre><h2 align="center">"Project 2: Building a Simple Blog Layout.</h2>
        After creating a personal portfolio, the next step in your HTML journey is to build a simple blog layout.
        This project will introduce you to more complex structures and how to organize content effectively on a webpage.</pre><br>

        The third project, let's shift gears and focus on <b>creating a landing page</b>.
        A landing page is a pivotal element in web design, often serving as the first point of contact between 
        a business or individual and their audience. This project will help you learn how to design an effective 
                                 and visually appealing landing page.</pre><br>

        Creating an <b>eCommerce page</b> is an excellent project for web developers looking to div
        into the world of online retail. This project focuses on designing a web pagethat 
        showcases products, product descriptions, prices, and a shopping cart.</h2><br><hr></pre>

        <pre><h2 align="center">"Project 5: Developing a Recipe Page</h2>
        Everybody loves a great recipe from their grandparents — so why not make a quick webpage to show it off?
        Given that grandma and grandpa probably won’t learn CSS or HTML anytime soon, it’s a great opportunity 
        to commit your favorite recipe to digital memory.My recipe is for Grandma’s Secret Apple pie.
        If you read the recipe carefully, you’ll notice a few missing pieces. Apparently, Grandma didn’t use
        pie crust, and there’s no bake time specified. Of course, that’s not the point; what I want to show is
        that with just a bit of CSS and HTML knowledge, you can create a quick and easy recipe page or a page for any kind of list.

               <pre> Stroke Diesel Engine — Construction
Cylinder and Cylinder Head: cylinder liner, combustion chamber in the cylinder head, ports for valves and injector.

Piston: crown, skirt, fitted with compression and oil rings.

Connecting Rod: links piston to crankshaft; small end on piston pin, big end on crank journal.

Crankshaft and Crankcase: converts reciprocating motion to rotary motion; supported by main bearings in the crankcase.

Intake Valve and Exhaust Valve: poppet valves in the cylinder head that control air inlet and exhaust outlet.

Fuel Injector: high-pressure nozzle that atomizes diesel into the combustion chamber.

Camshaft and Valve Train: camshaft (driven by gear/chain/belt) operates valves via tappets/rocker arms.

Fuel Pump and Governor: supply and meter fuel quantity and control engine speed.

Cooling and Lubrication Systems: water jacket around cylinder, oil sump and pump for lubrication.

Labeled diagram
Click/open the card above to download the neat diagram showing a cross-sectional view of the engine and four small sketches for the Intake, Compression, Power, and Exhaust strokes.

Working principle — overview
The engine completes one working cycle in four strokes of the piston (two crankshaft revolutions). Air alone is drawn in and compressed to a high temperature; fuel is injected near the end of compression and auto‑ignites, producing the power stroke. The four strokes are: Intake (suction), Compression, Power (expansion), and Exhaust.

Stroke‑by‑stroke operation
1. Intake (Suction) stroke
Piston movement: Top Dead Centre (TDC) → Bottom Dead Centre (BDC).

Valves: Intake valve open, Exhaust valve closed.

Flow: Fresh air is drawn into the cylinder as the piston moves down.

Goal: Fill the cylinder with air only; no fuel at this stage.

2. Compression stroke
Piston movement: BDC → TDC.

Valves: Both valves closed.

Action: Air is compressed to a high pressure and temperature; typical diesel compression ratios range from about 14:1 to 23:1.

Result: Air temperature rises sufficiently for auto‑ignition when fuel is injected.

3. Power (Expansion) stroke
Timing: Fuel injector injects finely atomized diesel into the hot compressed air slightly before or at TDC (injection timing varies by design).

Ignition: Injected diesel auto‑ignites; rapid combustion raises cylinder pressure.

Piston movement: TDC → BDC under high pressure.

Valves: Both valves closed for most of this stroke.

Output: High pressure acts on the piston top, producing the useful work transmitted through the connecting rod to the crankshaft.

4. Exhaust stroke
Piston movement: BDC → TDC.

Valves: Exhaust valve open, Intake valve closed.

Flow: Burnt gases are expelled from the cylinder into the exhaust manifold as the piston rises.

Cycle repeat: At the end of exhaust stroke, intake valve opens and the next intake stroke begins.

Valve timing and fuel injection notes
Valve timing: Intake opens slightly before BDC of the exhaust stroke and closes slightly after BDC of the intake stroke to improve volumetric efficiency; exhaust opens before TDC on the power stroke to begin gas release.

Injection timing: Starts close to TDC of the compression stroke; advance is used to ensure peak pressure occurs at an optimal crank angle for torque and efficiency.

Atomization and spray pattern: Proper nozzle design and high injection pressure ensure fine droplets and fast mixing with hot air for reliable combustion.

Important performance characteristics
High thermal efficiency due to high compression ratio.

Good low‑speed torque and fuel economy.

Robust construction suits heavy duty and long life applications.

Typical applications
Heavy road vehicles (trucks, buses), tractors, construction equipment, stationary generators, marine engines, and other high‑load uses.
